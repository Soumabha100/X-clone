X-Clone is a feature-rich, full-stack social media application engineered to mirror the core functionalities and user experience of X (formerly Twitter). Built on the MERN stack, this project demonstrates a robust, scalable, and high-performance web architecture, from a secure RESTful API to a dynamic, responsive frontend.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The application is architected with a decoupled frontend and backend, a standard practice for modern, scalable web services.

- **Frontend:** A dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React** and **Vite**, deployed on **Vercel** for global content delivery and performance.
- **Backend:** A secure, stateless RESTful API powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, hosted on **Render**.
- **Database:** A **MongoDB Atlas** cluster serves as the data persistence layer, with schemas designed for efficient data relationships and query performance.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent development, scaling, and maintenance of the client and server.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Security

- **Secure JWT Authentication:** Employs JSON Web Tokens stored in `httpOnly` cookies, providing robust protection against XSS attacks. The system is configured with secure, cross-domain policies for production environments.
- **Full Credential Management:** Includes user registration with validation, login with either email or username, and a secure password reset flow.

### 2. Content & Feed

- **Full Tweet CRUD Functionality:** Users can create (with text and images), read, update, and delete their own posts.
- **Dual-Mode Content Feed:** The main feed offers two distinct timelines: a public "For you" feed for content discovery and a personalized "Following" feed.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Implemented for a smooth, uninterrupted browsing experience on all feeds.

### 3. Social Engagement Ecosystem

- **User Interaction:** Core social features including liking, commenting, and retweeting are fully implemented.
- **Bookmarking:** Users can save tweets to a private, dedicated "Bookmarks" page for later viewing.
- **Social Graph:** A complete follow/unfollow system allows users to curate their own social network.

### 4. User Experience & Performance

- **Optimistic UI Updates:** State is managed globally with **Redux Toolkit**, providing instant UI feedback for actions like liking and following.
- **High-Performance Data Fetching:** **TanStack Query (React Query)** is used as a caching layer to minimize network requests, resulting in instantaneous page loads for previously visited profiles and a significant reduction in loading states.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** A notification system alerts users to new followers, likes, and comments, with a dynamic badge in the UI displaying the unread count.
- **Cloud Media Management:** Image uploads for profiles and posts are handled seamlessly via **Cloudinary**, ensuring fast content delivery and optimized media transformations.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive, crafted with **Tailwind CSS** to provide an optimal experience across all devices.
